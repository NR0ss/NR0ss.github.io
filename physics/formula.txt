Specific charge = charge / mass


Minimum energy for pair production is 2 lots of the rest energy


Threshold frequency = work function / h


e x Vs = max kinetic, e is the charge of an electron and Vs is the stopping potential


Wave speed = distance / time


μ = M / L,         mass per unit length = mass of string / length 


Tension in investigating resonant frequency = mg,                m is the mass of the objects pulling on the string


Constructive interference occurs when the path difference is nλ


Destructive interference occurs when the path difference is (n + ½)λ


In double slit, sin(theta) = path difference / slit seperation


In double slit, tan(theta) = fringe spacing / Distance between slit and screen


Weight = mg


Momentum = mass x velocity


Impulse = change in momentum


Extension = new length - original length


Energy per unit volume = ½ x stress x strain


Energy = (current) x (potential difference) x (time) = (curent)2 x (resistance) x (time)


Angular speed = (angle object turns through) / time


Kelvin = (degrees celsius) + 273


pV = constant,                p is pressure and v is Volume (only valid if temperature is constant)


V / T = constant,        V is volume and T is temperature (only valid if pressure is constant)


p / T = constant,        p is pressure and T is temperature (only valid if volume is constant)


Work done = pressure x (change in volume)


(time period of orbit)2 is directly proportional to (radius)3


Escape velocity = square root of (2GM / r),        G = gravitational constant, M = mass of planet


For capacitor charging, V = V0(1 - e-t / RC)


For capacitor charging, I = I0e-t / RC


For capacitor discharging (decay), V = V0e-t / RC


For capacitor discharging (decay), I0(1 - e-t / RC) ask about this as I’m not sure


N = nNA,        N is number of atoms, NA is avogadro constant, n is the the number of moles


A = A0e-λt,        A is the activity, A0 is the activity at t = 0


Average binding energy per nucleon = binding energy / nucleon number


1/ f = 1/u + 1/v,        f is focal length, u is the object to lens, v is lens to image
(if v is negative then it is a virtual image)


Collecting power is directly proportional to (dish diameter)2


Intensity = power / (4 x pi x d2),        d is the distance from star
